This is an unofficial Pulseview windows installer to use the raspberry pi pico on windows.

Github limits filesizes to 25MB but it is 40MB.  I think you should be able to download this without creating a drobox account.

It is recommended that you uninstall previous versions first. 

You may need to install this to get msvcr100.dll
